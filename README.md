Mini rooms manager in one webpage.

Mini:
- No need CMS, only use it.
- No user managment, only one passcode in config file.
- No need install, only copy to folder, and add rights for web users.

All data is stored in the "rooms" directory.
All displayed messages are in the "config.php" file, you just 
have to change it to that language ...
